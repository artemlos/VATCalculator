# VAT Calculator

This library does two things:

1. Computes the VAT given a country and VAT.
2. Verifies VAT with the EU Comission's SOAP app.

> When verifying VAT, don't view this as an on-demand service, since it might
fail occasionally due to errors or maintanance (see 
[this document](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/help.html))
